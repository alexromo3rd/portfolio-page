## Explanation

BlocJams is an online music player application built on the AngularJS framework. It displays multiple albums and allows the user to click into each album to view and play the songs associated with that album.

## Problem

This application was originally built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. The goal was to rewrite the application using Angular.

## Solution

Bacon ipsum dolor amet filet mignon meatball spare ribs fatback bacon shankle. Kielbasa andouille fatback salami, boudin bresaola pig alcatra turkey spare ribs jerky. Corned beef bresaola leberkas salami alcatra beef landjaeger venison shank bacon meatloaf beef ribs picanha. Leberkas sausage brisket porchetta shankle prosciutto chicken picanha kielbasa pig kevin t-bone turducken filet mignon jowl.

## Results

The result from this rewrite is a fully functional music player application written in fewer lines of code. It is now easier to navigate the code base and find certain files because of the way Angular is structured. In the non-angular version of this app, one of the .js files had almost 300 lines of code!

## Conclusion

Using Angular for the first time was very challenging, but it was also very rewarding. I definitely had a lot more fun writing this app using Angular and now I feel more confident in my ability to use frameworks.
