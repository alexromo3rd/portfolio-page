I live in Long Beach, California with my wife and two pups. I'm currently enrolled in the Web Developer track at Bloc.io looking to make a career change.

I began my programming journey roughly two years ago using any resource I can get my hands on. I studied at CodeCademy, Udemy, Free Code Camp, and other resource I stumbled upon. This eventually led me to discovering Bloc and sitting in on a few of their online info sessions.

I thought about enrolling in their Rails Fundamentals track but I wanted to make sure that if I were to invest in a program it had to be one that prepared me for a Jr Web Developer position. Eventually they announced their Part-Time Web Developer track and I knew it was perfect for me!

Follow me on my journey by checking back every week for a new blog post!
