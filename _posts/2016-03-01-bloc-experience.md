My experience at Bloc has been nothing short of awesome! Everyone that I have spoken with has been super friendly and helpful, including my mentor. There was a small hiccup in the beginning when my original mentor went on paternity leave and the substitute mentor assigned to me dropped me a day before our scheduled mentor session.

Bloc’s Mentor Lead Tim did reach out to me personally apologizing for the inconvenience and added an additional week onto my program so I didn’t lose out on this mentor session. The next day I was assigned a new mentor and it’s been a smooth ride since.

The curriculum feels very well balanced. They do a little bit of hand holding to introduce you to certain topics and programming methods, and immediately challenged you to solve coding problems you would see in real world applications. This forces you to learn how to problem solve using resources such as stack overflow, google, and other resources that Bloc provides you with in that particular checkpoint. I prefer this style of teaching as it helps reinforce what you learn rather than just reading some information and copying code. 

I also really like that Bloc has assessments after each phase. They want to make sure you truly understand what you just learned before they allow you to move forward in the program. This prevents students from getting halfway through the program before realizing they don’t understand what is going on. I can’t tell you how many times this happened to me while I was first learning how to program. It’s easy to follow along with a prerecorded video and nod and say “uh huh that makes sense” but when it comes times to put it all together and build something, you don’t know where to begin or you may not know how to implement what you just saw.

Overall I’ve been extremely happy and am excited to move into phase two of the PTWD track after my 2nd assessment. Wish me luck!
