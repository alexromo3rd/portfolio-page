title: Decision to Enroll in Bloc's PTWD Track
---
Man oh man...Talk about the best decision I ever made!

Enrolling in Bloc's Part-Time Web Developer Track is something I thought long and hard about. The first thing I did was scour the internet searching for as many reviews as I could possibly find. I searched Reddit, Course Report, Quora, Switchup, and all sorts of personal blogs looking for, and reading through, all of the reviews no matter if they were positive or negative. I wanted to make sure I was making the right decision since the cost of the program was almost as much as an in person bootcamp!

A lot of the reviews I came across were positive which helped put my mind at ease.

When I finally made up my mind that this was something I wanted to do, invest my time and hard earned money into this amazing program, I spoke with my wife and let her know that I would be committed 110% to this program. She was reluctant at first, when I mentioned how much the program costs, but ultimately agreed that this option would be the best option for me to learn how to program and make a career change.
