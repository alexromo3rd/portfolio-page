title: Goals as A Frontend Developer
---
The reason I decided to go with Bloc’s PTWD track was because it covers the frontend AND the backend. Even though was much more interested in backend development when I joined Bloc, I knew it would be important to understand what is going on in the frontend even if you decide to stick with the backend. 

I really enjoyed working with Angular while building Bloc Jams and Bloc Chat. In my opinion, using Angular for frontend development makes it much more enjoyable. I’ve tried building static web pages using HTML, and CSS and didn’t really find it very interesting. Once I was introduced to JavaScript and Angular, I was very excited. 

Angular allows you to organize your code so you that you don’t have one huge JavaScript file holding all of your code. You can break down your JavaScript files by controllers and services, as well as your main app.js file which makes it easier to locate the code for a particular page or feature in your application.

My goals have changed since I started the program. At first all I wanted to do was learn enough frontend so that I can get by, but now I think I’d be happy working in either frontend or backend. I would say my goal now is to learn enough Angular to be able to get a job as a Jr. Web Developer.
